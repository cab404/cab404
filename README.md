### Hi there :wave: I'm Cab!

Still love **NixOS**, hate/love **Python**. **Android+Kotlin** in the past, **Rust** in the present, **Typescript** somewhere in between.

I also have some stuff on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/cab404)

**Fun facts**\
:printer: love to tinker with 3D printers\
:space_invader: made a [hackerspace](https://undef.club), and then [another one](https://github.com/hackerembassy/)\
:star: was making silicone sex toys for quite some time\
:heart: PR on first sight\
:unicorn: am a sparkling unicorn princess

Pronouns: all of them.
